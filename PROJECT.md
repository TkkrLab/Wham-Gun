# <a name="intro"></a>Introduction

So abit of a backstory,
One of our partners at our job(i create eletronic toys for a living) they have this weird rule which says, when stuff related to our products breaks it gets send to us. Why? I don’t know, but we got a box with “stuff”.

Including a broken one of these

Its a Kit gun wich you can hook up to a compressor

I was given the thing with the idea “I’t would be cool to have a flashlight build into it”, like a Flash gun. I had a different plan, as these are the things people tent play with, everytime they see one. Like bbq tongs, you gott test a cip them atleast once.
   
# <a name="MakingOf"></a>So what did i made
I had these sound recording modules layout around from alie express.

They are easy to modify, and even come pre-soldered with different component depending on whichever you needed.

The one of my left has a Light sensor, but can be replaced with a button behavior. (bottom left)

So I unscrewed the kit gun, and clued in a piece of a pcb behind the trigger with a push button and attached a wire between the button and the sound recorder.

It was working, but needed some better sound, the speaker wasnt big enough to impress.

After taking appart a desktop speaker(trash aswell), replacing the tiny inferior speaker with the superior larger one was easy enough with some soldering. 

This did caused some issues… mainly power. The three internal the batteries had to be replaced with 3 larger aa battery’s. The chip starts playing when powered, which meant it started playing the first note, causing a voltage drop, which killed the chip.
Then the battery’s would return to the usual voltage, and the chip would attempt to start playing again.
Thi is a usefull feature if i ever want it to play when pressed, just have to rewire to power the chip through the button. Now it just plays the full 30 seconds without any way of turning it off.

# <a name="Wham-gun"></a>Presenting the Wham Gun
Duck tape, and a few cauting of paint later in the colours of the north pole pole and.. WHAM.. the Wham gun was created.
This thing you can just lay about the office and people will pick it up, “trigger it” and automatically lose the whamageddon.

There is also no shutting it off and its extremely noisy. Can hear it from a next few rooms over.

# <a name="improvements"></a>Future improvements
A cone might be nice  to increase gun – aim functionality. But for now I like it as is.

I could pray paint it in different colours and record different melody’s. Like rick roll, or phaser blast after december.

When going for the phase blast id suggest not attaching the button to the sensor area, but instead break the power. (the module plays when its powered). This way you can cut of phaser blasts and actually piew piew with it.

Maybe 3d print a holder for the speaker, the duck tape is very ghetto.
